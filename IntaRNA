# Webserver is here: 

# However the webserver can only cope with 100 mRNA or mRNA < certain length due to space. 
# Can instead install and run using the cmd line.

# See https://github.com/BackofenLab/IntaRNA#instwin
# Can install via bioconda

## To run:
# You want an input (target) sequence (your mRNA) and a query sequence (your miRNA)
# You can directly type these in if you wish, and provide them with names to label the output:
--tId="mRNA with GC"
IntaRNA -t CCCCCCCCGGGGGGGGGGGGGG -q AAAACCCCCCCUUUU --tId="mRNA with GC" --qId="sRNA-example"

# To run multiple mRNAs/miRNAs at once, use fasta files:
# running IntaRNA with FASTA files
IntaRNA -t myTargets.fasta -q myQueries.fasta
# Note that .gz files are supported. 

# An alternative to the above would be the following, but it does the same thing. 
# reading query FASTA input from stream via pipe
# cat myQueries.fasta | IntaRNA -q STDIN -t myTargets.fasta

# If you have a whole transcriptome, and you want to look at just part of it, you can restrict what you analyse:
# restrict prediction to the second load of 100 target sequences
IntaRNA -t myTranscriptome.fasta --tSet=101-200 -q myQuery.fasta
# To restrict to a subset of miRNA, you would use --qSet instead.

# Nucleotide encodings different from ACGUT are rewritten as N and the respective positions are not considered to form 
# base pairs (and thus ignored). Thymine T encodings are replaced by uracil U, since we apply an RNA-only energy model.

# For a list of general program argument run -h or --help. 
# For a complete list covering also more sophisticated options, run --fullhelp.
